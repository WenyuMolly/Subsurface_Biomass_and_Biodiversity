# Contents of DiversityAnalyses

This directory contains code and data files to perform the diversity analyses of "The biomass and biodiversity of the continental subsurface". Codes are adapted from https://github.com/LennonLab/ScalingMicroBiodiversity/ to include diversity data from the continental subsurface.

## Set-up 

* Codes are linked to a "micro" directory. This directory can be accessed from  https://github.com/LennonLab/ScalingMicroBiodiversity/tree/master/data/micro and should be added to the "data" directory prior to executing the code found here.
